# Sub-Agent Coordination Workflow

## Overview
This document defines how the Product Manager, Game Developer Engineer, and Quality Assurance sub-agents coordinate to deliver high-quality game features efficiently.

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Planning Phase
**Lead**: Product Manager
- Product Manager defines feature requirements with SNES-era game design principles
- Specifies gameplay mechanics, player experience goals, and success criteria
- Creates clear, actionable specs that reference classic game examples

**Support**: 
- Developer reviews specs for technical feasibility
- QA reviews specs to understand testing requirements

### 2. Implementation Phase
**Lead**: Game Developer Engineer
- Implements features according to Product Manager specifications
- Writes clean, performant code with game feel in mind
- Creates basic unit tests for core functionality
- Communicates progress and any technical constraints

**Support**:
- Product Manager available for clarification and iteration
- QA provides early feedback on testability

### 3. Verification Phase
**Lead**: Quality Assurance
- Verifies implementation matches specifications
- Runs test suite and checks code coverage
- Reviews code for obvious issues
- Tests gameplay experience and edge cases

**Support**:
- Developer fixes identified issues
- Product Manager validates feature direction

## Communication Flow

### Feature Development Cycle
1. **Spec Creation** (Product Manager → Developer & QA)
   - Clear requirements with success criteria
   - Reference to classic game mechanics
   - Priority and scope defined

2. **Implementation Planning** (Developer → Product Manager & QA)
   - Technical approach outline
   - Estimated timeline
   - Potential risks or limitations

3. **Progress Updates** (Developer → Team)
   - Daily progress on implementation
   - Blockers or questions
   - Ready for testing notifications

4. **Quality Reports** (QA → Developer & Product Manager)
   - Test results and coverage metrics
   - Specification compliance status
   - Issues with severity and reproduction steps

5. **Feature Completion** (Team)
   - QA sign-off on quality
   - Product Manager approval on experience
   - Developer confirmation of stability

## Handoff Points

### Product Manager → Developer
- Feature specification document
- Mockups or reference gameplay videos
- Priority and deadline information
- Success metrics

### Developer → QA
- Implemented feature code
- Basic test suite
- Known limitations or issues
- Setup/testing instructions

### QA → Developer
- Bug reports with reproduction steps
- Code quality feedback
- Test coverage gaps
- Performance issues

### QA → Product Manager
- Feature compliance report
- User experience observations
- Quality metrics summary
- Release readiness assessment

## Conflict Resolution

### Specification Disputes
- Product Manager has final say on feature design
- Developer can propose alternatives with technical rationale
- QA can flag spec issues that impact quality

### Technical Decisions
- Developer leads on implementation approach
- Must meet Product Manager's requirements
- Must pass QA standards

### Quality Standards
- QA sets minimum quality bar
- Negotiable based on timeline with Product Manager input
- Developer proposes solutions for quality issues

## Best Practices

1. **Early Communication**: Share concerns as soon as they arise
2. **Iterative Feedback**: Don't wait for "perfect" - share progress often
3. **Mutual Respect**: Each role brings critical expertise
4. **Player Focus**: All decisions should improve player experience
5. **Documentation**: Keep specs, code, and test plans updated

## Success Metrics

- Features delivered match original vision
- Code quality meets standards (tests, coverage, no major issues)
- Development velocity remains high
- Team satisfaction and collaboration quality
- Player satisfaction with final product

Remember: Great games come from great teamwork. Each agent plays a crucial role in delivering the magic of classic gaming with modern quality standards.
